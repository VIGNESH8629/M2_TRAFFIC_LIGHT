* Traffic light control systems are widely used to monitor and control the flow of automobiles through the junction of many roads.
* Traffic Light Controllers (TLC) are based on microcontroller and microprocessor in ATMEGA328p.
* They aim to realize smooth motion of cars in the transportation route.
* Instead of being embedded in the pavement, these sensors are mounted overhead to detect the presence of vehicles in an intersection. 
* The two types of infrared traffic sensors are active infrared sensors and passive infrared sensors.If it is any signal  red or green or yellow  and Emergency vechile
Ambulances  signal that ultrasonic sensor detect and  shows it lcd display.
* The disparity of cars flow with time, the accidents, the passage of emergency vehicles, and the pedestrian crossing are not implemented in the existing traffic system. 
This leads to traffic jam and congestion .
* Moreover, a portable controller device is designed to solve the problem of emergency vehicles stuck in the overcrowded roads.
