# AIM
Traffic signals are designed to ensure an orderly flow of traffic,  vehicles to cross an intersection
and help reduce the number of conflicts between vehicles entering intersections from different directions.

# Objectives
 the main objectives includes:
 
 * Traffic signals are used to manage conflicting requirements for the use of road space â€“ often at road junctions 
   by allocating right of way to different sets of mutually compatible traffic movements during distinct time intervals.
 * Light traffic signals play a major role in the traffic flow.
 * In order to preserve decorum, such traffic signals control the movement and flow of traffic.
 * Emergency ambulances vechiles to go any traffic signal .
 * They control the speed of vehicles on main as well as on secondary roads.
 
 # Signal
 # Red
   Red light on: This tells drivers to stop.
 # Yellow
   Yellow light on: This tells drivers to stop when it is safe to, because the light is about to turn red.
 # Green
    Green light on: This means the driver can start driving or keep driving
 
 # SWOT Analysis
 
 # Strength
 * High reliability of the controller and his low cost.
 * Complete delivery of traffic lights with the controller and decrease at the expense of it of the cost of the product.
 * LED traffic lights have the advantages of low power consumption, long life span, and higher brightness.
 * Traffic signals help for movement of traffic securely without any collision. 
 * They can reduce the number of accidents on roads like pedestrian accident and right-angle collision of two cars.
 
 # Weakness
 * They may cause a delay in the quick movement of traffic.
 * Traffic control signals may result in a re-entrant collision of vehicles.
 # Opportunities
 * When properly timed, a traffic signal increases the traffic handling capacity of an intersection.
 * There will also be a provision for either manual operation or pre-programmed operation.
 # Threats
 * TLP is a set of designations used to ensure that sensitive information is shared with the appropriate audience.
 *  It employs  three colors to indicate expected sharing boundaries to be applied by the recipients.
